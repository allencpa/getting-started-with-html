  <b>Allen's Notes</b>
<br>
<br>
1. Connection
<br>
<br>
Users connect to servers by use of the internet. When we do this we are asking servers for documents that are written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"> HTML</a>. Hyper text mark up is simply the language that our web browser uses to display text, image, and other references. 
<br>
<br>
2. HTML
<br>
<br>
HTML is made up of smaller parts - texts, markup, and references. Instructions are notated by elements, inside of tags. Examples of tags include: 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. &lt;b&gt - is the bold tag which bolds the content within the open and closing b tag.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. &lt;em&gt - is the emphasis tag, which italicizes the content
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. &ltimg&gt - is the image tag. This tag links the content to a specific image url. Also, this tag has no closing tag because it is a void tag.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. &lt;br&gt - is the break tag. The break tag inserts a line break, this is needed because HTML truncates spaces if not instructed to do otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. &ltp&gt - is the paragraph tag. The paragraph tag is similar to the break tag, however it is consider a block tag instead of an inline tag. My understanding of the p tag is limited for now, but I believe it treats the content of the element seperately, which allows customability.
<br>
<br>
3. Summary
<br>
<br>
Just by writing this assignment, I couldn't instruct the computer to display what I wanted to express because I did not know the code. I had to refer to Google and search for help, and immediately I was able to show spaces and tags as plain text. I hope that as I progress with Udacity, my understand and skill level will grow.
